Laptop
======

Laptop is a script to set up an macOS laptop for software development.

It can be run multiple times on the same machine safely.
It installs, upgrades, or skips packages
based on what is already installed on the machine.

Requirements
------------

Supported systems:

* macOS Sierra (10.12)

Older versions may work but aren't regularly tested.
Bug reports for older versions are welcome.

Install
-------

Download the script:

```sh
curl --remote-name https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gerardo/laptop/master/mac
less mac
```

Execute the downloaded script:

```sh
sh mac 2>&1 | tee ~/laptop.log
```

Optionally, [install gerardo/dotfiles][dotfiles].

[dotfiles]: https://github.com/gerardo/dotfiles

Debugging
---------

Your last Laptop run will be saved to `~/laptop.log`.

And some more! Check the [mac-components/](mac-components) directory.

It should take less than 15 minutes to install (depends on your machine).

Customize in `~/.laptop.local`
------------------------------

Your `~/.laptop.local` is run at the end of the Laptop script.
Put your customizations there.
For example:

```sh
#!/bin/sh

brew bundle --file=- <<EOF
brew "Caskroom/cask/dockertoolbox"
brew "go"
brew "ngrok"
brew "watch"
EOF

default_docker_machine() {
  docker-machine ls | grep -Fq "default"
}

if ! default_docker_machine; then
  docker-machine create --driver virtualbox default
fi

default_docker_machine_running() {
  default_docker_machine | grep -Fq "Running"
}

if ! default_docker_machine_running; then
  docker-machine start default
fi

fancy_echo "Cleaning up old Homebrew formulae ..."
brew cleanup
brew cask cleanup

if [ -r "$HOME/.rcrc" ]; then
  fancy_echo "Updating dotfiles ..."
  rcup
fi
```

Write your customizations such that they can be run safely more than once.
See the `mac` script for examples.

Laptop functions such as `fancy_echo` and
`gem_install_or_update`
can be used in your `~/.laptop.local`.
